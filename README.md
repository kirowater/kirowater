  Researching computer cheats as a hobby, currently more interested about anti-cheating.  
  I don't pick sides, without cheaters there wouldn't be anti-cheats neither.  
  In generally I like the cat and mouse game, and excited to see what is going to be the final solution. ~~ ekknod

  Anti-Cheating and cheating are actually the very same thing, both requires same creative mind.
  VAC/EAC/Vanguard are good examples of cool anti-cheats, because they are less likely to cause harm for non cheating players. ~~ ekknod
